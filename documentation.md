## Background
For this website I have chosen to solve a real world problem that is currently going on across the globe, for this task I am going to create a website that attempts to publicize information related to the current global pandemic, coronavirus. I have chosen this topic as the current information on the virus seems to differ from website to website, I think that a website that has combined information from multiple sources would provide a better way to be able to make informed decisions on what to do in this confusing time. I would also like the website to be able to display live statistics on some stats that relate to the global pandemic.

## Colour Choices
For the colours of this website I will be using very simple colours that will allow the reader to be able to focus on the content rather than how the website looks, I have gained inspiration from some other websites that relate loosely to my websites content that I am creating such as the common cold website (www.commoncold.org).  For my website I will be using a simple light blue background colour that is pleasing to the eye and allows the content to be read very easily, for other elements on my website such as the navigation bar buttons I will use a darker blue colour which will be a nice contrast to the background colour.  I will also be adding black borders to elements of my website that I feel need to stand out against the rest.

## Accessibility 
For my website I will be trying to accomodate for all people, this means that I will be using the w3c accessibiity page when designing my pages.  To accomodate for all people, when adding images to my website I will add alternate tags that will describe the image, this is so that screen readers and similar software will be able to commiuncate what the image is to an impared person. Another factor that I will consider will be displaying content for the visually impared, I will make sure that the website is very clear to read so that they have no trouble reading it.

## GDPR
Since I will not be collecting any personal-information on the website I dont need to worry about the general data protection act, this also means that I wont need to create a privacy policy however if I was storing personal information on my website I would need to create a privacy policy.

## Distance selling
This coronavirus website wont need to conform to the online distance selling act as I wont be selling anything on it, however if I was going to sell anything on the website then I would need to think about the rules and regulations surrounding online selling.

## Evaluation
After completing the website I can now evaluate on what I have created.

I feel that I have created a website that gives some general information on the coronavirus pandemic, but I found creating a website on this topic was quite challenging since there is so much conflicting information on the web that it was quite hard to decide what information would be right to include on mine, but in the end I mostly used the NHS's information to create my website as the information was the most up to date.  I feel that I have created a website that gives some of the basics of the coronavirus and would provide a basis to make informed decisions.

One of the main features of my website is the stats page, this page took me quite a while to do as the statistics are called from an API and the displayed on the page using javascript, this was quite a big undertaking for me as I've never used javascript but the statistics load with a simple animation when the page loads.

A complication that I had with this website would be changing the websites layout for the mobile phone, I found this difficult as I had already set up the website for the desktop and my css wouldnt change to what I wanted after adding the breakpoints, but after much trial and error I seem to have fixed most of the problems I was having.

To test this website I used the built in chrome functions, as this was the easiest way to test all the different resolutions such as a mobile, tablet, and desktop display.
