            <h4>There is not currently a cure for COVID-19 or a vaccine against coronavirus. The aim of treatment is to manage and reduce symptoms until you have recovered. Most people - around 80% - have an asymptomatic or mild infection which can be treated
                at home. In this case, you should self-isolate for at least one week until you have recovered. One in five people who contract COVID-19 will require hospital care. Around 15% of cases experience a severe infection requiring oxygen to help
                with respiratory symptoms. 5% experience critical infections, requiring ventilation. Those at a higher risk of severe or critical infections include older people and those with underlying health conditions.</h4>

            <h1>The official word on face masks</h1>
            <h2>Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the official advice from the World Health Organization has been that only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are
                suspected to have the coronavirus. Nobody else needs to wear a mask, and experts have given several reasons for that.</h2>
