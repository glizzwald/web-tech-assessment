            <h2>Should you wear a mask?</h2>
            <p>If you’re out in a public setting where it’s difficult to follow physical distancing guidelines, the CDCTrusted Source recommends that you wear a cloth face mask that covers your mouth and nose. When worn correctly, and by large percentages
                of the public, these masks can help to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. That’s because they can block the respiratory droplets of people who may be asymptomatic or people who have the virus but have gone undiagnosed. </p>
