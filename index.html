            <h2>Some basic information about the virus</h2>
            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing
                pandemic. As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.56 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 308,000 deaths. More than 1.64 million people have recovered. </p>

            <p>Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.
                This is wrapped in a icosahedral protein shell. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface,
                which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.</p>
